<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I have 8 years of experience with web development. I have worked in
many different layers of software development, including backend,
frontend, mobile and infrastructure. My main focus is backend and I
advocate code quality, readability and maintainability. I include tests
on my daily development practice, along with TDD and refactoring.</p>
<p>My main skill is learning, and I like to stretch it in daily
challenging situations. I was lucky to have had the opportunity to join
my first three jobs without knowledge of the technologies involved and
have learned them. I love environments where I can grow, surrounded by
smart and interesting people.</p>
<p>I love to code, and more specifically, I love programming languages
and paradigms. In my free time, I have experimented with many
programming languages and technologies, including SML, Python, Ruby,
Haskell, Scala, Go, Rust, Racket, Bash, Clojure, etc and even designed
my own language. I’m also confident working with fast delivery,
continuous integration and many agile ideas. I’m fluent in Portuguese
and English and also a game and music enthusiast.</p>

Developer at Babbel</h3>
<p><small>August 2017 - present</small></p>
<p>At Babbel I help build APIs and platform support for mobile and web
clients. A big part of the work is designing good APIs that can be used
by current and future company initiatives. I’m also participating on the
microservice extraction initiative, as well as helping bring the
development, testing, infrastructure and interviewing practices up to
date. We deal with lots of AWS services and automated infrastructure. I
was a major contributor to migration of user’s vocabulary from MySql to
DynamoDB.</p>
<p>I also contribute to Babbel’s engineering strategy, helping teams
become more autonomous and spreading knowledge about content
distribution and overall architecture. My work in this area resulted in
my promotion to Principal.</p>

<p>I joined a team of full-stack developers at Movinga and immediately
started working on a micro service and its three client applications. I
was also responsible for starting a couple of frontend applications from

<p>We developed a single page application for a remote client in New
York. I was hired not only because I knew some of the technologies
involved but also because I was willing to learn the ones I didn’t know.

<p>We developed systems for startups. It was my first experience with
Rails, but also included frontend development. Since each developer was
responsible for managing a whole project, our responsibilities involved
coding, creating interfaces, thinking about user experience, negotiating
with clients, managing infrastructure and deployment, etc.</p>
<p>I was one of the first people to be hired on our branch of the
company, so I had the opportunity to help build the culture we wanted. I
