<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I have <strong>14 years of experience</strong> developing software
professionally. I have worked in many different layers of software
development, including <strong>backend</strong>,
<strong>frontend</strong>, mobile and infrastructure, although I focus
on backend. I advocate <strong>code quality</strong>, readability and
maintainability. <strong>Tests</strong> are part of my development
practices, along with <strong>TDD</strong> and refactoring. I’m
confident working with small and <strong>fast delivery</strong>,
<strong>continuous integration</strong> and many <strong>agile</strong>
ideas. I also have experience designing distributed services,
microservices and <strong>REST APIs</strong>. I’m a big fan of
<strong>observability</strong>.</p>
<p>I like environments where I can grow, surrounded by smart and
interesting people. I like to work with <strong>respectful</strong>,
<strong>open-minded</strong> people who care about their systems, tools
and code.</p>
<p>I love to <strong>code</strong>! I’m a <strong>NixOS</strong>,
<strong>terminal</strong> and <strong>neovim</strong> user. I often
learn new programming languages, frameworks and technologies in my free
time. I have experimented with many programming languages including SML,
Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scala, <strong>Go</strong>, Rust, Racket, Bash,
Clojure, IO, Javascript, Typescript and many others. I even designed my
own language <a href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/marco">marco</a>.
I always have at least one active coding side project. You can find more
details about personal projects, passions and open source on my <a
href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/">Github Profile</a> and my <a
href="https://juanibiapina.github.io/">blog</a></p>
