<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I have <strong>14 years of experience</strong> developing software
professionally. I have worked in many different layers of software
development, including <strong>backend</strong>,
<strong>frontend</strong>, mobile and infrastructure, with focus on
backend. I advocate <strong>code quality</strong> and <strong>continuous
delivery</strong>. <strong>Tests</strong> are part of my development
practices, along with <strong>TDD</strong> and refactoring. I’m
confident working with <strong>agile</strong> practices that enable
<strong>fast delivery</strong> in small increments. I also have
experience designing distributed services, microservices and
<strong>REST APIs</strong>. I’m a big fan of <strong>tooling</strong>
and <strong>observability</strong>.</p>
<p>I like environments that support <strong>growth</strong>, working
along with <strong>smart</strong>, <strong>respectful</strong> and
<strong>open-minded</strong> people who care about their systems, tools
and code.</p>
<p>I love to <strong>code</strong>! I’m a <strong>NixOS</strong>,
<strong>terminal</strong> and <strong>neovim</strong> user. I often
learn new programming languages, frameworks and technologies. I have
worked professionally with Java, Javascript,
<strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> and
<strong>Go</strong>, but have also experimented with SML, Python,
Haskell, Scala, Rust, Racket, Bash, Clojure, IO, and many others. I
designed <a href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/marco">my own toy
language</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/basherpm/basher">package
manager for Bash</a> and an <a
href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/sub">organizer for command line
scripts</a> that I use as part of my <a
href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/dotfiles">12 years old
dotfiles</a>. I try to keep at least one active coding side project. You
can find more details about personal projects, passions and open source
on my <a href="https://github.com/juanibiapina/">Github Profile</a> and
my <a href="https://juanibiapina.github.io/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also a <strong>game</strong>, <strong>music</strong> and
<strong>climbing</strong> enthusiast.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="principal-software-developer-at-babbel">Principal Software
Developer at Babbel</h3>
<p><small>August 2017 - present</small></p>
<p>As a Principal at Babbel, I work in the Content Platform team,
developing the learning content CMS and related content distribution
<strong>APIs</strong>. We design <strong>cross-team
architecture</strong>, striving for <strong>small deliverables</strong>
that bring value to users and allow teams to achieve their
<strong>goals</strong> and work <strong>independently</strong>.</p>
<p>Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Pipeline</strong>: Designed an integration between
Babbel’s <strong>CMS</strong> and <strong>Contentful</strong>, enabling
fast creation of content for new learning experiences. This system now
holds content for more than 20 learning experiences, fulfilling the
company goal of experimenting with new forms of learning. Teams can
<strong>autonomously</strong> create new types through Pull Requests.
All content is <strong>Git</strong> versioned and
<strong>immutable</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Content Deployment</strong>: Led a multi-year project to
enable content editors to deploy content. Through a series of
<strong>modeling</strong> changes, API improvements,
<strong>monitoring</strong>, data migrations, <strong>test</strong>
improvements, education and even a Slack bot, Babbel went from one
painful content deployment per quarter to several uneventful content
deployments per week.</li>
<li><strong>Content Modeling</strong>: Designed an extensible new data
model for current and future Babbel content, inspired by
<strong>NixOS</strong> and served through a <strong>GraphQL</strong>
API. The new model is backwards compatible but also enables new use
cases involving personalization and AI integration.</li>
<li><strong>Content APIs</strong>: Designed <strong>RESTful</strong>
content APIs for current and future company initiatives, focusing on
<strong>performance</strong> and <strong>cacheability</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Workshops</strong>: Organized internal
<strong>presentations</strong> and <strong>workshops</strong> about
Babbel’s content domain and architecture, <strong>empowering</strong>
other teams and content creators.</li>
<li><strong>API Gateway tooling</strong>: Improved build times
(<strong>from 15m to 5m</strong>) and tooling for Babbel’s main API
Gateway, shared between teams. Developers can simply run
<code>make</code> and all checks run locally using
<strong>Docker</strong> with zero setup required. The same setup runs on
<strong>CI</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Documentation</strong>: Started a documentation
initiative to create developer-friendly documentation in repositories.
Many teams have adopted this practice and maintain Git versioned
documentation.</li>
<li><strong>User vocabulary migration</strong>: Migrated all user
vocabulary from <strong>MySql</strong> to <strong>DynamoDB</strong>. It
went from 7 unmaintainable, untested joins, to a performant and scalable
single table design.</li>
<li><strong>Service extraction</strong>: Actively drove or participated
in many service extractions from the <strong>Rails</strong> monolith,
including user vocabulary, content, authorization, b2b, accounts and
user progress <strong>services</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>API Tests</strong>: Wrote a suite of <strong>API
Integration</strong> tests (mostly for myself, at the beginning). It has
grown and is now a valuable tool used by many teams to find
regressions.</li>
<li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: Mentored <strong>junior</strong>,
<strong>professional</strong> and <strong>senior</strong> developers,
directly supporting their <strong>growth</strong> to higher roles,
including several promotions to <strong>Principal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Advice and support</strong>: Teams contact me on a weekly
basis to discuss system design. Babbel already includes
<strong>observability</strong> and <strong>automated
infrastructure</strong> by default, so I often advise about sound
<strong>domain entities</strong> with clear nomenclature, well defined
<strong>system boundaries</strong> and responsibilities, <strong>small
deliverables</strong>, and then small deliverables a few more
times.</li>
<li><strong>Principal Role</strong>: I was the first engineer to be
promoted to Principal. I helped define the role and its responsibilities
drawing from my own experience temporarily moving between teams.</li>

team, we were responsible for ingesting raw television content videos
and encoding them for online streaming. We worked on a system that
provided both an UI and an API for uploading videos and metadata. This
system was distributed in more than 50 locations across Brazil,
gathering and processing videos from all partners. We processed more
than 2.5TB of videos on a weekly basis, accounting for more than a
thousand hours of content.</p>
