<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I have 6 years of experience with web development. I have worked in many different layers of software development, including backend, front end, mobile and server automation. My main focus is back end and I advocate code quality, readability and maintainability. I include tests on my daily development practice, together with TDD and refactoring.</p>
<p>My main skill is learning, and I like to stretch it in daily challenging situations. I was lucky to have had the opportunity to join my first three jobs without knowledge of the technologies involved and have learned them. I love environments where I can grow, surrounded by smart and interesting people.</p>
<p>I love to code, and more specifically, I love programming languages and paradigms. In my free time, I have experimented with many programming languages and technologies, including SML, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scala, Go, Rust, Racket, Bash, Clojure, etc and even my own language, Marco. I’m also confident working with fast delivery, continuous integration and many agile ideas. I’m fluent in Portuguese and English and also a game and music enthusiast.</p>
