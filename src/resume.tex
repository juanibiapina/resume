\cvsection{Experience}

\cvevent{Staff Software Engineer}{Babbel}{Aug 2017 -- Feb 2025}{Berlin, Germany}

{\RaggedRight
I worked in the Content Platform team, developing the learning content CMS and related content distribution \accentbold{APIs}. We designed \accentbold{cross-team architecture}, striving for \accentbold{small deliverables} that bring value to users and allow teams to achieve their \accentbold{goals} and work \accentbold{independently}. Accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
\item \accentbold{Content Pipeline}: Designed an integration between Babbel's \accentbold{CMS} and \accentbold{Contentful}, enabling fast creation of content for new learning experiences. This system now holds content for more than 20 learning experiences, fulfilling the company goal of experimenting with new forms of learning. Teams can \accentbold{autonomously} create new types through Pull Requests. All content is \accentbold{Git} versioned and \accentbold{immutable}.
\item \accentbold{Content Deployment}: Led a multi-year project to enable content editors to deploy content increasing deployments from one per quarter to several per week.
\item \accentbold{Content Modeling}: Designed an extensible new data model for current and future Babbel content, inspired by \accentbold{NixOS} and served through a \accentbold{GraphQL} API. The new model is backwards compatible but also enables new use cases involving personalization and AI integration.
\item \accentbold{Content APIs}: Designed \accentbold{RESTful} content APIs for current and future company initiatives, focusing on \accentbold{performance} and \accentbold{cacheability}.
\item \accentbold{Workshops}: Organized internal \accentbold{presentations} and \accentbold{workshops} about Babbel's content domain and architecture, \accentbold{empowering} other teams and content creators.
\item \accentbold{API Gateway tooling}: Improved build times (\accentbold{from 15m to 5m}) and tooling for Babbel's main API Gateway, shared between teams. Engineers can simply run `make` and all checks run locally with zero setup required. The same setup runs on \accentbold{CI}.
\item \accentbold{Engineer-friendly Documentation}: Started a documentation initiative to create engineer-friendly documentation in repositories. Many teams have adopted this practice and maintain Git versioned documentation.
\item \accentbold{User vocabulary migration}: Migrated all user vocabulary from \accentbold{MySql} to \accentbold{DynamoDB}. It went from 7 unmaintainable, untested joins, to a performant and scalable single table design.
\item \accentbold{Service extraction}: Actively drove or participated in many service extractions from the monolith, including user vocabulary, content, authorization, b2b, accounts and user progress \accentbold{services}.
\item \accentbold{API Tests}: Wrote a suite of \accentbold{API Integration} tests (mostly for myself, at the beginning). It has grown and is now a valuable tool used by many teams to find regressions.
\item \accentbold{Mentoring}: Mentored \accentbold{junior}, \accentbold{professional} and \accentbold{senior} engineers, directly supporting their \accentbold{growth} to higher roles, including several promotions to \accentbold{Staff}.
\item \accentbold{Advice and support}: Teams contact me on a weekly basis to discuss system design. I advised about sound \accentbold{domain entities} with clear nomenclature, well defined \accentbold{system boundaries} and responsibilities, \accentbold{small deliverables}, and then small deliverables a few more times because the \accentbold{project only starts once it's in production}.
\item \accentbold{Staff Role}: I was the first engineer to be promoted to Staff. I helped define the role and its responsibilities drawing from my own experience working across teams.
\end{itemize}
