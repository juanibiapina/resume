## About me

I have 14 years of experience developing software professionally. I have worked
in many different layers of software development, including backend, frontend,
mobile and infrastructure. I advocate code quality, readability and
maintainability. Tests are part of my development practices, along with TDD and
refactoring. I’m confident working with small and fast delivery, continuous
integration and many agile ideas. I also have experience designing distributed
services, microservices and REST APIs. I'm a big fan of observability.

I like environments where I can grow, surrounded by smart and interesting
people. I like to work with respectful, open-minded people who care about their
systems, tools and code.

I love to code! I'm a terminal and neovim user. I often learn new programming
languages, frameworks and technologies in my free time. I have experimented
with many programming languages including SML, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scala,
Go, Rust, Racket, Bash, Clojure, IO, Javascript, Typescript and many others. I
even designed my own language [marco](https://github.com/juanibiapina/marco). I
always have at least one active coding side project. You can find more details
about personal projects, passions and open source on my [Github
Profile](https://github.com/juanibiapina/) and my
[blog](https://juanibiapina.github.io/)

I’m also a game, music and climbing enthusiast.

improve deployment times, frequency (from once every two weeks to 10 times a
day) and provide better insights about our prices.

responsible for receiving and encoding videos to be prepared for internet
delivery. We worked on a system that provided both an UI and an API for
uploading videos and metadata. This system was distributed in more than 50
locations across Brazil, gathering and processing videos from all partners. We

a thousand hours of content.

of the development, so I had the opportunity to work with a Go backend hosted
on Google App Engine, an Android and an iOS application. All of these
technologies were new to me.

Accomplishments:

- Created a pipeline for building and deploying android and iOS apps to their respective stores, improving the testing and release cycles

<small>March 2013 - November 2014 _(1 year 9 months)_</small>

We developed a single page application for a remote client in New York. I was
hired not only because I knew some of the technologies involved but also
because I was willing to learn the ones I didn't know. This was a project that
could change very fast.

Accomplishments:

- Automated the deployment process and reduced the total time from 2 hours down to 160 seconds.
- Helped migrate a legacy application from Grails to Rails
- Experimented with virtual machines, docker and several deployment strategies

### Software Developer at Codeminer42

<small>July 2012 - February 2013 _(8 months)_</small>

We developed systems for startups. It was my first experience with Rails, but
also included frontend development. Since each developer was responsible for
managing a whole project, our responsibilities involved coding, creating
interfaces, thinking about user experience, negotiating with clients, managing
infrastructure and deployment, etc.

I was one of the first people to be hired on our branch of the company, so I
had the opportunity to help build the culture we wanted. I learned a lot from
the experience and it helped shape some of my future career goals.

Accomplishments:

- Migrated an application from rails 2 to rails 4
- Helped shape the office culture
- Developed a project from conception to delivery

Consisted mainly of consulting and web development for the retail industry,
with daily client facing situations. I worked mostly on maintaining and
developing new features for a large legacy Java code base. Teams were
distributed across Brazil, India and the US.

This was my first contact with agile practices. I have learned much from it,
including the importance of pair programming, TDD and Continuous Integration. I
had a mentor that helped me build most of my ideas about development.

Accomplishments:

- Started an initiative to improve development and feedback cycles
- Introduced Javascript unit tests into the project
- Started a culture of looking into build status
- Extended the development tools, greatly improving development speed and team motivation
