## About me

I have 14 years of experience developing software professionally. I have worked
in many different layers of software development, including backend, frontend,
mobile and infrastructure. I advocate code quality, readability and
maintainability. Tests are part of my development practices, along with TDD and
refactoring. I’m confident working with small and fast delivery, continuous
integration and many agile ideas. I also have experience designing distributed
services, microservices and REST APIs. I'm a big fan of observability.

I like environments where I can grow, surrounded by smart and interesting
people. I like to work with respectful, open minded people who care about their
systems and the code.

I love to code! I often learn new programming languages, frameworks and
technologies in my free time. I have experimented with many programming
languages including SML, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scala, Go, Rust, Racket, Bash,
Clojure, IO, Javascript, Typescript and many others. I even designed my own
language [marco](https://github.com/juanibiapina/marco). I always have coding
side projects. You can find more details about personal projects, passions and
open source on my [Github Profile](https://github.com/juanibiapina/) and my
[blog](https://juanibiapina.github.io/)

I’m also a game, music and climbing enthusiast.

## Experience

### Principal Software Developer at Babbel

<small>August 2017 - present</small>

At Babbel I help build APIs and platform support for mobile and web clients. A
big part of the work is designing good APIs that can be used by current and
future company initiatives. I'm also participating on the microservice
extraction initiative, as well as helping bring the development, testing,
infrastructure and interviewing practices up to date. We deal with lots of AWS
services and automated infrastructure. I was a major contributor to migration
of user's vocabulary from MySql to DynamoDB.

I also contribute to Babbel's engineering strategy, helping teams become more
autonomous and spreading knowledge about content distribution and overall
architecture. My work in this area resulted in my promotion to Principal.

Technologies:

- Ruby
- Rails, Terraform
- DynamoDB, AWS Batch, AWS DMS and many other AWS services

### Senior Full-Stack Software Developer at Movinga

<small>Feb 2017 - August 2017</small>

I joined a team of full-stack developers at Movinga and immediately started
working on a micro service and its three client applications. I was also
responsible for starting a couple of frontend applications from scratch. Later
we extracted a pricing micro service from the main legacy code in order to
improve deployment times, frequency (from once every two weeks to 10 times a
day) and provide better insights about our prices.

Technologies:

- Ruby, Javascript
- Grape, React, Redux and other supporting libraries for both frontend and
  backend
- AWS, Docker

### Senior Software Developer at Globo.com

<small>May 2015 - Jan 2017</small>

I joined Globo.com to work on the web media platform team. Our team was
responsible for receiving and encoding videos to be prepared for internet
delivery. We worked on a system that provided both an UI and an API for
uploading videos and metadata. This system was distributed in more than 50
locations across Brazil, gathering and processing videos from all partners. We
processed more than 2.5TB of videos on a weekly basis, accounting for more than
a thousand hours of content.

Accomplishments:

- Designed a content protection microservice that integrates with 3 third party
    APIs
- Participated on hiring interviews for most people hired in the Porto Alegre office
- Started an initiative to gather video encoding metrics and better understand
    our system

- Mongo and Redis

### Senior Software Developer at Bearch, Inc.

We developed an anonymous social network. The whole team worked with all parts
of the development, so I had the opportunity to work with a Go backend hosted
on Google App Engine, an Android and an IoS application. All of these
technologies were new to me.

Accomplishments:

- Shipped a huge amount of features in very little time due to our experimental
    nature
- Created a pipeline for building and deploying android and IoS apps to their
    respective stores, improving the testing and release cycles

    Camera
- Worked daily with unknown technologies and new challenges

### Software Developer at e-Core

<small>March 2013 - November 2014 _(1 year 9 months)_</small>

We developed a single page application for a remote client in New York. I was
hired not only because I knew some of the technologies involved but also
because I was willing to learn the ones I didn't know. This was a project that
could change very fast.

Accomplishments:

- Automated the deployment process and reduced the total time from 2 hours down
    to 160 seconds.
- Helped migrate a legacy application from Grails to Rails
- Experimented with virtual machines, docker and several deployment strategies

### Software Developer at Codeminer42

<small>July 2012 - February 2013 _(8 months)_</small>

We developed systems for startups. It was my first experience with Rails, but
also included frontend development. Since each developer was responsible for
managing a whole project, our responsibilities involved coding, creating
interfaces, thinking about user experience, negotiating with clients, managing
infrastructure and deployment, etc.

I was one of the first people to be hired on our branch of the company, so I
had the opportunity to help build the culture we wanted. I learned a lot from
the experience and it helped shape some of my future career goals.

Accomplishments:

- Migrated an application from rails 2 to rails 4
- Helped shape the office culture
- Developed a project alone from conception to delivery

Technologies:

### Development Consultant at ThoughtWorks

<small>January 2011 - June 2012 _(1 year 6 months)_</small>

Consisted mainly of consulting and web development for the retail industry,
with daily client facing situations. I worked mostly on maintaining and
developing new features for a large legacy Java code base. Teams were
distributed across Brazil, India and the US.

This was my first contact with agile practices. I have learned much from it,
including the importance of pair programming, TDD and Continuous Integration. I
had a mentor that helped me build most of my ideas about development.

Accomplishments:

- Started an initiative to improve development and feedback cycles
- Introduced Javascript unit tests into the project
- Started a culture of looking into build status
- Extended the development tools, greatly improving development speed and team
    motivation
